# Devstack

Devstack is a CLI for scaffolding your next full stack application with a CLI instead of setting up your frontend, backend and Docker containers separately. Conveniently scaffold your frontend and backend with different frameworks of your liking with a single command.

## Installation 

```sh
git pull https://github.com/thatcatfromspace/devstack
cd devstack 
npm install
```

To run the CLI,

```sh
npx devstack
```

Additionally, if you want to install the CLI globally,

```sh
npm i -g .
```

## Framworks supported

This list is subject to change and expand.

### Frontend

- React (with Vite)
- Next.js

Both frontend options come with TailwindCSS ready to use üöÄ

### Backend

- Nest.js
- Django

Both backend options provide basic CRUD and auth services.

# Contributions

Create an issue if you want to request a framework of your liking. All contributions through pull requests are welcome. Additionally, 
contributing boilerplate for different frameworks is also encouraged.
